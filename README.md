#                                             CODE REFACTORING

This is my project where I started with a non accessible html and refactoring using semantic html. This is making more accessible to people using screen readers and helping with search engine optimization. I used nav tags for navigation, main tags for the main content, and headers to specify content at the head as well as footers for content at the foot of page.
